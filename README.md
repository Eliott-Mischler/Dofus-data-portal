# Dofus data portal

This app serves the front-end display and data analysis services that can be leveraged from the data collection of Dofus-scanner.

## Installation 

To use this application, clone this repo, run `npm install` and add a PostgreSQL database connection (connecting to the same DB as Dofus-scanner) inside a file named `.env` at the root of the project folder. Then, running `npm run dev` will serve the web application locally.
